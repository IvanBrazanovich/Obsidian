RULE 5: APPRECIATE everything your associates do for the business. A paycheck and a stock option will buy one kind of loyalty. But all of us like to be told how much somebody appreciates what we do for them. We like to hear it often, and especially when we have done something we're really proud of.
Nothing else can quite substitute for a few well-chosen, well-timed, sincere words of praise. They're absolutely freeâ€”and worth a fortune
