RULE 6: CELEBRATE your successes. Find some humor in your failures.
Don't take yourself so seriously. Loosen up, and everybody around you will loosen up. Have fun. Show enthusiasmâ€”always. When all else fails, put on a costume and sing a silly song. Then make everybody else sing with you. Don't do a hula on Wall Street. It's been done. Think up your own stunt. All of this is more important, and more fun, than you think, and it really fools the competition. "Why should we take those cornballs at Wal-Mart seriously?"
